KNITML CHANGELOG
=====================
http://www.knitml.com

Changes in version 0.5.0 (????-??-??)
-------------------------------------

General
* New projects from refactoring effort:
  * knitml-knitting-engine: the knitting simulation component from knitml-validation
  * knitml-el: the Knitting Expression Language (formerly in knitml-tools)
  * knitml-command-line: command line only utilities

knitml-core
* Added 'version' to pattern element (for compatibility tracking)
* Added 'no-stitch' element to support charting

knitml-pattern-renderer
* Chart rendering
* Internal refactoring of model (from visitor to event handler)
* Removed Renderer <-> RenderingContext circular dependency 
* RendererProgram is far simpler; all user preferences are within Options element

knitml-el
* Added 'before' keyword so that phrases like '2 sts before end' flow more naturally

Known Incompatibilities with previous release:
* Instruction and inline-instruction elements defined under an instruction-definitions section must have the 'shape' attribute set
* Pattern element must have 'version' attribute set corresponding to the schema version in use (this release: 0.5)
* Pattern renderer configuration files (i.e. applicationContext-patternRenderer.xml) are completely incompatible with previous releases

knitml-tools
