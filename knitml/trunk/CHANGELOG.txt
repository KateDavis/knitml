=====================
http://www.knitml.com

Changes in version 0.5.0 (????-??-??)
-------------------------------------
General
* New projects from refactoring effort:
  * knitml-knitting-engine: the knitting simulation component (formerly in knitml-validation)
  * knitml-el: the Knitting Expression Language (formerly in knitml-tools)
  * knitml-command-line: command-line utilities (formerly in knitml-tools)
* Removed knitml-tools project

knitml-core
* Added 'version' to pattern element (for compatibility tracking)
* Added 'no-stitch' element to support charting
* Added 'stitch-holder','slip-to-stitch-holder', and 'from-stitch-holder' elements

* Complete support for user-supplied preferences
* Chart rendering with three symbol providers (text art, Knitters Symbols, and Aire River Knitting Font)
* Option to generate HTML pattern instead of plain text

* Refactored internal model (visitors became event handlers)
* Removed Renderer <-> RenderingContext circular dependency
* JAR now has OSGi manifest headers 

knitml-el
* Added more broken word syntax support (such as 'before end' instead of 'beforeEnd')
* Began building individual test cases for function names (before relied on functional test cases from samples directory)

knitml-command-line
* validateAndRender now equivalent to render
* convertValidateAndRender now equivalent to convertAndRender

Known Incompatibilities with previous release:
* Instruction and inline-instruction elements defined under an instruction-definitions section must have the 'shape' attribute set
* Pattern element must have 'version' attribute set corresponding to the schema version in use (this release: 0.5)
* Pattern renderer configuration files (i.e. applicationContext-patternRenderer.xml) are completely incompatible with previous releases

Changes in version 0.4.1 (2008-12-04)

General
* Support for increases
* Support for stitch crosses (i.e. cables)
* Support for custom inline / block instruction definitions
* Support for instruction merging

* Some incompatible XML schema changes in this release. E-mail Jonathan for details.

knitml-tools

knitml-validation
