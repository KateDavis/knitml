Welcome to the KnitML Project. Our goal is to develop and promote adoption of a
standard content model for knitting patterns. By developing a community-supported
specification (KnitML) and providing basic rendering and transformation tools, the
KnitML Project aims to make KnitML easy to use and valuable to the knitter.
