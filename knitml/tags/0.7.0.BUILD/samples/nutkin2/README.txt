This sample takes the structure of the Basic Sock pattern and applies it to a more complex sock.
In addition to the techniques illustrated in the Basic Sock pattern, it shows you how to:
- define a global instruction
- merge global instructions together
- work the next row of a global instruction (i.e. apply-next-row)
- repeat a set of operations for each row in another instruction (i.e. for-each-row-in-instruction)
- increase
